### 👋 Hi, I'm Jonas

I'm currently working on practical applications of AI and LLMs, especially in education and NLP research.

### 🚀 Projects & Interests

**📚 Course Chatbots @ Tilburg University**  
Building course-specific chatbots that help students learn smarter. These bots use **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to pull info straight from lecture slides and study materials, then generate helpful answers — always with source citations.  
  _🔒 Code lives on GitLab (private/internal)_

**🧠 MSc Data Science Thesis – Building a BERT Model & Exploring Gender Bias**  
Training a BERT model from scratch to study how gender bias arises in transformer architectures. My focus is on uncovering structural biases and proposing ways to mitigate them — part research, part experiment, all curiosity.

**🏆 Msc Marketing Analytics Thesis - Improving recommendation systems**  
My first thesis explored improving recommendation systems using contextual embeddings (e.g., from ChatGPT) vs. traditional TF-IDF. Proud to say it earned the **Best Thesis Award** and a **cum laude** degree!
